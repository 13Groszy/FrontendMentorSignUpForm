# Frontend Mentor - Intro component with sign up form solution

This is a solution to the [Intro component with sign up form challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/intro-component-with-signup-form-5cf91bd49edda32581d28fd1). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

Mobile first workflow is the key so I started with it. Desktop version needed some media queries to looks like the original design.
JS script has been done after the main design was completed.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

For the first time I have used two backgrounds and they looks pretty cool! By two backgrounds I mean background color and background image on body and they, suprisingly for me, work fine together.

### Continued development

More JS practice to save the code. Actual JS file have 30 lines from around 50 at the start. Optimalisation is the main key for me right now.
